# JeffTheAI
######Jeff the AI is a small project I am working on to stop me from getting bored in computer science class. My goal is to make him in pure C Sharp - using only one class and only a minimal amount of namespaces. Oh and not to mention - entirely by myself...

##Todo:
- [x] Sort out reply function's "foreach" issue
- [x] Make Jeff 'learn'
- [ ] Sync learn file to the internet
- [x] Create .jeff framework
- [ ] Give learn file the ".jeff" file extention (easy fix)

###Acknowledgements: 
- Lucky for the name - Jeff

YOU WILL NEED .NET FRAMEWORK 4.5+ TO RUN JEFF AND VISUAL STUDIO TO COMPILE HIM.
(However, you can use some web based IDEs online - they usually tend to have a worse result, though)
