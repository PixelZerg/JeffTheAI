# JeffTheAI
######Jeff the AI is a small project I am working on to stop me from getting bored in computer science class. My goal is to make him in pure C Sharp - using only one class and only a minimal amount of namespaces. Oh and not to mention - entirely by myself...

##Todo:
- [x] Sort out reply function's "foreach" issue
- [x] Make Jeff 'learn'
- [ ] Sync learn file to the internet
- [x] Create .jeff framework
- [ ] Give learn file the ".jeff" file extention (easy fix)
- [ ] When "independantly enquiring" - make Jeff add it on to the last entry if there is a repettiton 
- [ ] Give Jeff emotions (semi-done)
- [x] Make Jeff work with KRelay
- [x] If Jeff doesn't know what to say - make a randomly generated sentence
- [x] Drop internal data completely and use only "q" and "say" files
- [x] If you say either "leet", "l337", "l33+", etc to Jeff, he will say everything in l337 from then on
- [x] Add "either way, therefore" mode
- [x] When saying something - mix up the words and use some synonyms for basic words like "good" etc
- [x] Make the console look pretty (Jeff talks in multicolor)
- [x] If you say "code" jeff will show some random code
- [x] make the random code effect last for a random amount of time
- [x] add reverse mode, when activated - Jeff will speak backwards
- [x] fix error given when you input blank
- [x] if you say something that contains the words "draw" and "rectangle" - Jeff will draw an ASCII rectangle
- [x] Change word order - Jeff will mix up the word order for sentences (but retain the sentence's meaning, of course)
- [x] Implement the Learning Wizzard
- [x] Make it so you can define the coordinates and size of the rectangle in the rectangle drawer
- [x] If you say "wait" Jeff will show you some of the stuff it's doing to work out a reply to you
- [x] add internal exception handler
- [x] if the jeff files are courrupted - warn the user
- [x] Run a last "final" function before actually saying the final result - just to add some filters, and double checks

###Acknowledgements: 
- Lucky for the name - Jeff
- Harry for suggesting the "either way, therefore" mode

YOU WILL NEED .NET FRAMEWORK 4.5+ TO RUN JEFF AND VISUAL STUDIO TO COMPILE HIM.
(However, you can use some web based IDEs online - they usually tend to have a worse result, though)
